## Components

### CoordinatePlane.js

``` javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
```

This line imports required code from the react library.

``` javascript
const CoordinatePlane = ({ shapes }) => {
```

This line defines a functional react component.  
A functional react component is like a function but it doesn't require a class etc. and it returns a react element.
